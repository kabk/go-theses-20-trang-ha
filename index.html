            <p class="bodyTxt">
              It started almost like a horror movie themed with Holocaust, yet this time with scattering bodies of fish instead of human, big and small, buried half under the sand and half above the water. The smell of rotten marine animals, heavily fuming all over Ha Tinh, Vietnam, would intoxicate any citizen who dared to take a bite of these deadly creatures. Yet as the fish dissolved into the ground they collided with the bodies of many human beings, buried there fifty years ago when the city of Hue was heavily massacred. In 2019, 39 Vietnamese people from the same town were given the chance to live yet they chose to die, not in their own land but somewhere far away. Illegally. The three different narratives, separated by time and space, eventually came together as one: the sum of an overly stressed piece of land. The flux that was established through these different time-space events revealed the inner structure of violence and crimes. Their consequences, once had been triggered, continue to transform, penetrate, and influence as they sail through and overlap one another.

            <p class="bodyTxt">Meanwhile in Iceland, 2010, a volcano erupted like a real catastrophe. It has covered the sky of Europe in dark ashes. It has in fact, paralyzed Europe.</p>
              <p class="refQuote">“For the first time, Europe turned into a real physical space that has been measured through tangible spatial and temporal coordinates.”</p>
            <p class="bodyTxt">Flight industries were stagnated. Other dependencies? Convulsed. For 8 days, Europe seemed to have come to an end. But far away in the crowd, in the myriad of those vexed tempers, a tiny voice set forth a demand: “Test the planes! Test the planes! We need to fly!” and at an ineffable speed, the world hasted back to its norms. The norms of fumes, toxics, chemicals and plastics!</p>
              <p class="refQuote">“The Earth is evil. We don’t need to grieve it.”</p>
            <p class="bodyTxt">
              The Earth is 75% water. Its atmosphere are majorly nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. A slight disruption to this ratio, in a matter of time, would throw us all into chaos. But these elements are not what we consume. What we consume is fish sauce—something delicious, something exotic, something fun! However, sauce is water: it is nitrogen, oxygen as well as carbon dioxide. It is the omnipresence that runs the factories, drives the cars, flies the airplanes. It is also the tsunami, the earthquake and the hurricane. It is a fluid that is embedded in the flux. And once it tumbles, it crumbles the world.

            <p class="bodyTxt">
              “The Earth is evil.” We ate a sauce and it made disasters! But what compassion there is for us when we are forever ruled by the language of the old? When our dogmatic system is indestructible? Can we even speak about our wrong doing? Let us not speak, let us “taste”.

              The voice of an individual is not always an individual. It can be the sum of many individuals whose passions can be linked to promote the existence of an idea. Similar to how the world is constructed as a gigantic network. When you touch upon a node, the vibration travels through the connectors until it mobilizes the whole structure containing it.

              In front of me is the artwork “Galaxies Forming along Filaments” of Tomás Saraceno. I am borrowing the methodology of the interpretation Bruno Latour made on this artwork to talk about subjects that are too local and/or non-relatable to understand from a singular perspective. By doing this I spoke through the voices of others, as if I were justifying their vulnerability to subjectiveness. I agree that there is no true objectiveness. But coming from a background where hegemony is taking questionable turns, I rather see the benefits of multiple egos working together to form a multidimensional surface rather than a flat solid community that wanders in a shadeless void.

              In this thesis is a myriad of different spatial and temporal localities. The majority of the examples are taken from events circulating around Vietnam but the stress is not on the improvement of Vietnamese identity but on its relation to other identities. The later half of the thesis introduces two parts: a view on an environmental intoxication and an analysis on two fictional narratives about disasters on Earth. With the inclusion of visual and theatrical  expressions, I hope the words I deliver with flow more easily in the thinking process without major linguistic interruptions.
