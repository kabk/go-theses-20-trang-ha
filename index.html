              It started almost like a horror movie themed with Holocaust, yet this time with scattering bodies of fish instead of human, big and small, buried half under the sand and half above the water. The smell of rotten marine animals, heavily fuming all over Ha Tinh, Vietnam, would intoxicate any citizen who dared to take a bite of these deadly creatures. Yet as the fish dissolved into the ground they collided with the bodies of many human beings, buried there fifty years ago when the city of Hue was heavily massacred. In 2019, 39 Vietnamese people from the same town were given the chance to live yet they chose to die, not in their own land but somewhere far away. Illegally. The three different narratives, separated by time and space, eventually came together as one: the sum of an overly stressed piece of land. The flux that was established through these different time-space events revealed the inner structure of violence and crimes. Their consequences, once had been triggered, continue to transform, penetrate, and influence as they sail through and overlap one another.

              The Earth is 75% water. Its atmosphere are majorly nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. A slight disruption to this ratio, in a matter of time, would throw us all into chaos. But these elements are not what we consume. What we consume is fish sauce—something delicious, something exotic, something fun! However, sauce is water: it is nitrogen, oxygen as well as carbon dioxide. It is the omnipresence that runs the factories, drives the cars, flies the airplanes. It is also the tsunami, the earthquake and the hurricane. It is a fluid that is embedded in the flux. And once it tumbles, it crumbles the world.

              In front of me is the artwork “Galaxies Forming along Filaments” of Tomás Saraceno. I am borrowing the methodology of the interpretation Bruno Latour made on this artwork to talk about subjects that are too local and/or non-relatable to understand from a singular perspective. By doing this I spoke through the voices of others, as if I were justifying their vulnerability to subjectiveness. I agree that there is no true objectiveness. But coming from a background where hegemony is taking questionable turns, I rather see the benefits of multiple egos working together to form a multidimensional surface rather than a flat solid community that wanders in a shadeless void.

              In this thesis is a myriad of different spatial and temporal localities. The majority of the examples are taken from events circulating around Vietnam but the stress is not on the improvement of Vietnamese identity but on its relation to other identities. The later half of the thesis introduces two parts: a view on an environmental intoxication and an analysis on two fictional narratives about disasters on Earth. With the inclusion of visual and theatrical  expressions, I hope the words I deliver with flow more easily in the thinking process without major linguistic interruptions.

                  Fish sauce. It is foul, it is smelly. You can recognize it from five kilometers away. If you’re one of the unlucky ones who have ever swiped your sleeves into fish sauce, you will know how impossible it is to get it off. All of your friends were clean and good-smelling while you were lingered with a faint fishy smell, and the fact that three days before the Lunar New Years, you all went for the Vietnamese restaurant at the corner of the street. So next time you shall eat with care, you shall use chopsticks properly and you shall not play with fish sauce.

                Fish sauce is a product. Regardless of its shelving environment—a European Albert Heijn supermarket in the Netherlands, or the Go Asia rip-off hub in Berlin, it has now been a common find amongst Western countries. Fish sauce has an interesting history as well as an interesting taste profile, which is controversially perceived both in the Western countries (in the global perspective and not the EU confined borders) and the Eastern ones. Its smell is awkwardly horrible in its raw form, resulting from rancid fermentation process of the protein, yet awkwardly umami for fine dining experience. It is commercially sold with “exotic” or “oriental” attached on the label or else very plasticky in terms of aesthetic to depict authenticity of its origin.

                <p class="selfQuote">
                  Umami is the only flavor profile that can achieve both surface and depth. Umami can be salty, savory or sometimes sweet but it must be able to send more perceptive signals to the brain than other stand-alone tastes. Umami can be experienced by consuming fermented products like soy sauce, fish sauce, pickles, mushrooms, cold-cut meats or cooked meats, and is superior than other tastes in that it leaves a sense of satisfaction and completeness. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is an artificially produced “umami” salt, much controversial in Europe but widely used and consumed in Asia. Natural umami is not hard to find but it requires one’s discern for gustatory harmony.

                  According to Edward Said, Orientalism is a half fictional half real reconstruction of the Eastern culture through the eyes of the Western culture. Orientalism started with the romanticized image of Arabian culture created by the French, the British and, later, Americans but is, in my opinion, not always confined to only such. Orientalism feeds idealistic images and concepts of Eastern cultures to Westerners in order to maintain interests but also to neutralize conflicting truths between the two. In Europe, there are debates and discussions about the Orient but not all of them interacts with or experiences actual opinions from the Orient. Although some stereotypes are true, it is more the ambiguity that created indestructible loopholes in the Western discourse about Orientalism. To treat Orientalism as a fairy tale is a total destruction of cultural diversities in Europe but to treat it as a self-driven entity is another misguided understanding.

                Roughly 80% of the companies selling fish sauce or its cousins wrongly guessed the true origin of this age old food item, which was mostly diluted in the context of Asian cuisine including that of Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese. The common assumption blinds the fact that “Garum”, a fermented liquid similar to fish sauce, was drunken in Ancient Greece 2300 years ago in elegant goblets. “Garum”, sharing similar values to fish sauce, is now a dead artifact, a forgotten child of colonial history and cultural domination.

                However, in the midst of all these conflicts, fish sauce, unlike cocoa, corns or tomatoes, etc, had a natural way of achieving its exotic status. It was not a desirable product; it was not economically profiting like gold and minerals, nor gastronomically profiting like sugar canes or cocoa. It was rejected, then reintroduced. It gained popularity only recently, when changes of conventions left society with more perceptions, more guts, more taste buds. Fish sauce verified its exotic status by first proving itself edible. One that was called “contaminating, dirty, unfiltered” now became the status of niche, of sub-culture and open-mindedness. However, before all the enlightenment, fish sauce was so outcasted by its perceived “spoilage” that its originality was left for those who dare to claim it, meaning Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and neighboring countries. Fish sauce’s connection to Vietnam is undoubtedly without the sum of other historical narratives (or “myths”), such as the Vietnam War, the Communists, the Soviet Union, Uncle Ho, the French or even the Thai etc. Although it was not outspoken in all of these stories, its essence remains: fish sauce is the intrinsic distillation of Vietnam.

                Myth is theorized in the work of Roland Barthes, who owes the structure to Ferdinand de Saussure’s work on semiology. In Barthes’ logic, a myth operates on the plane of three components: “the sign, the signifier and the signified.” The signifier is the “image” of the object being signified. The signified is the formulated perception of that object in our minds. And the sign is a linguistic unit that communicate the former two concepts and can be changed according to different social and cultural context. When the sign becomes the signifier, for example, when “red wine” (taken from Barthes’ example) is used to point to another concept, like “social class” or its media, it results in a new added meaning, which becomes the signified. Using Barthes’ formula, “fish sauce”, in its second order meaning, can refer not only to the smelly brown liquid but to “Vietnamese exotic dishes”, “swampy jungle”, “rude restaurant staff” or even “third world country”. These are highly externalized conclusion of Vietnamese culture but not necessarily the same to that of the Vietnamese.

                In places where the fish biomass is in excess, people must invent some preservation method to keep it from turning over. The reason is that fish, due to its high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids which oxidize outside of the cold water environment, is naturally more perishable than other meats. This makes fish a thrilling gem of all food items as eating it requires not only good manners but also good timing. Beside this momentary aspect, fish provides a luxurious mouth feel when eaten and requires its consumers to undergo all sophisticated layers of skins and bones to reach this luxury. Cooking fish also demands great attention and is not popular amongst busy home kitchens. A valuable trading product, fresh fish, out of all the great diversity of food, is the primary wealth of Vietnam. The secondary wealth is of fish sauce, or more elaborately, fish in its fermented stage. Fish sauce is not less delicious than its fresh counterpart. It is widely used as a flavor enhancer in various dishes in Vietnam and is one of the country’s the main protein source. The production of fish sauce, although equipment-friendly, involves a lot precise measurements to keep it from crossing the line with rancidity. During its fermentation stage, the fatty acids in fresh fish, once so detested yet now so cherished for its perishability, disintegrate into lower molecules, enzymes and bacterias under the help of salt, heat and time to built up the flavor profile this product. Once complete, fermented fish is distilled, bottled and either kept for use internally or transported for use outside of its production environment. The two status of fish, fresh and fermented, have transformed into two desirable expectations, its short-lived decadence and its noble aging. Here we see the two images of Vietnam, already shaped by its products beyond its border: a place for people to come and experience, and a product for people to try, to taste, to judge and to bring home. But it is wrong to assume that the existence of fish sauce in modern Western countries derived from the colonial period, when Western voyagers brought back “souvenirs” from exotic countries. Their main exploitation were mainly lands, women, minerals and raw ingredients and not smelly cultured products. The reasons for this denial of ethnicity, as can be seen in many Vietnam-War-themed movies, are due to hygiene and conventions. Back then, fish sauce was considered a product of the “others”, a product that went against what the Westerners perceived as normal and edible. It was strange, unfamiliar, alien, contaminating, dirty and ridiculous. “Trying to taste these food can, in fact, be seen as a sign of bravery.”

              <p class="bodyTxt">
                The mobilization of fish sauce to the West was of self-deportation. Fish sauce leaked through the border of Vietnam by its makers, the Vietnamese, who travelled oversea to establish new lives. In this way, it seemed, to an extent, a reversed colonization. But the Vietnamese did not come to Europe as conquerers, they came as refugees. Their decisions were not made but are nested in the decisions of others who had the power to control and prevail the ramification of war.
